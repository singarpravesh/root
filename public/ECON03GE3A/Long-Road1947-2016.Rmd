## Introduction
- From around 1950, the growth rate of national income went up from the funeral 1 per cent a year (less than 0.2 per cent per head) that prevailed in the first half of the century to 3.5 per cent a year (1.4 per cent per head) for 30 years thereafter.
- This growth was a welcome break; India had now entered a new era of a self-governing country.
- However, the <a title="You may still be wondering why call it “Hindu” rate of growth? The term was coined by Prof Raj Krishna who argued at one of his lectures in the late 70s that “..no matter what happens to the economy the trend growth rate in India will be 3.5%”. It was later used by a few economists to link the low growth rate of the 50s-80s period to Hindu beliefs of “Karma” & “Bhagya”.[Source](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/reclaiming-india/the-nonsense-about-the-hindu-rate-of-growth/)" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="hover" data-content="Some content">"Hindu rate of growth"</a>  of 3.5% during 1950-80 wa a major dissapointment.
- This growth rate was slower than the average, and could not create any dent in the level of poverty.

---

- From around 1980, there was a second marked change of gear to a growth rate of more than 6 per cent a year (4 per cent per head) for the next 35 years (1980–2015). 
- This was a major achievement that made India one of the fastest growing countries in the world and resulted in a considerable improvement in human welfare relative to the past. 
- Towards the end of this period, however, there were worrying signs that long-term growth was faltering, and that conditions were not yet in place for a rapid ascent to first-world levels of prosperity. 




- The broad distinction/division of the India's post-independent history can be centered on 1980, mainly due to the economic growth differentials.
- But still there were variations within the periods 1980-80 and 1980-2015.
- One can identify sub-periods with significant changes in growth rates.

---

- This chapter sketches with a broad brush the highlights of economic development and political narrative in the periods 1950–1980 and 1980–2015. 
- It focuses principally on growth and poverty policies and outcomes.
- In the first phase, 1950–1980, economic strategy largely followed a ‘command and control model’. 
- In the second phase, 1980–2015, economic strategy moved towards greater marketization, at first hesitantly, then more explicitly.

## THE ANCIEN REGIME: <mark1>A POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC NARRATIVE</mark1>
- 1947-1980 National political scene - Jawaharlal Nehru and his daughter Indira gandhi.
- The first three years of Nehru’s reign were taken up with stabilizing the country after the trauma of partition.
- Indicative planning made in 1950/51 but a more detailed, inter-sectoral, and a comprehensive planning came up only during the Second Plan (starting 1956/57).

---

- Acute foreign exchange crisis during the begining of the Second Plan led the policymakers tighten private sector activity.
- The growth during 1950-64 was significantly high at 3.9% (thanks to high rate of private investment).
- But at the same time, problems rigidness and inefficiencies of the cntrol system, the "quiet crisis" was diagonised in the early 1960s.

---

- After the death of Nehru in 1964, Lal Bahadur Shastri had to tackle a drought and war with Pakistan in 1965.
- Green revolution initiated.
- Indira Gandhi succeeds Shastri after his death in 1966.
- Two serious drought in 1965 and 1966 with a shrp rise in inflation daunt the Indian economy.

---

- Inorder to counter the ongoing 'quiet crisis', and under a lot of international pressure, India had to devalue its currency.
- The fruits of devaluation were not realised but the policy was blamed for accentuating problems like inflation and recession.
- This made Mrs. Gandhi backtrack on *liberalisation*, and she turned in a populist-socialist direction.
- Together with this policy, the military victory over Pakistan in 1971 led her to a landslide victory in the national election held that year.

---

- Encouraged by the developments, she moved even more firmly in the direction of *controls and state ownership*.
- There followed severe challenges in 1972–1974: two droughts, a quadrupling of the oil price, and raging inflation.
- The government responded with a monetary and fiscal crackdown but this led to widespread discontent.

---

-  In the ferment that followed, Mrs. Gandhi was challenged in the courts for some minor election offenses.
- In response, claiming that democracy and national unity were threatened, she imposed an Emergency in June 1975. Individual rights were suspended and the country acquired some of the characteristics of a police state.
- In 1979, there was a severe drought, the worst since independence, and a doubling of world oil prices. 
- As a result, inflation rose sharply. The Janata coalition split up; and in the election that followed, the Congress (I), led by Mrs. Gandhi, returned with a sweeping victory. 

---

- Unsurprisingly, given the internal disturbances, the exogenous shocks, and the iron grip of controls on economic activity, growth fell to 2.9 per cent a year from 1965/66 to 1979/80, a full percentage point below what it was during Nehru’s term of office.

## THE ANCIEN REGIME: <mark1>ECONOMIC POLICY AND PERFORMANCE</mark1>
- **Why did India fail to achieve rapid growth for three decades after independence (1950–1980)?**
  + Indian policymakers acted with a mistaken conception of the role of the state.
  + Convoluted regulation of economic activity created large inefficiencies and stifled business drive.
  + the state neglected to attend to areas where it should have been active. In particular, it failed to ensure that poor people could gain access to primary health care and education.

---

- growth was slow, even declined over time, despite
a doubling of saving and investment rates. 
- This clearly points to *low productivity of investment* as the main proximate reason for the poor performance.
- Low productivity in turn was the product of three features of economic policy: 
  + inappropriate and excessive state intervention in markets; 
  + the dominant role of the public sector; and 
  + neglect of critical social sectors.  
  
---

- The origins of the first two features lay in statist doctrines, characterised by antipathy towards business, contempt for the price mechanism, and hostility to international trade that had a special resonance in many post-colonial societies. 
- In India, a further twist was given to this kind of thinking by a ‘heavy industry’ strategy (based loosely on Soviet planning models), which was adopted in the Second Five Year Plan and used to justify the physical allocation of investment.

---

- It was widely understood that extensive government intervention and control would guide the private market activities towards the planned trajectory of output.
- But after the **controls** were established, <a title="Rent seeking is an economic concept occurring when an entity seeks to gain wealth without reciprocal contribution of productivity. The term rent in rent seeking is based on an economic rent which was defined by economist Adam Smith to mean payments made in excess of resource costs. An example of rent seeking is when a company lobbies the government for grants, subsidies, or tariff protection." data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="hover" data-content="Some content">rent-seeking</a> took over.
    + This led to the point where no economic activity could be legally pursued without obtainig dozens of permits and licences from different departments of government.
- Controls permeated every facet of business decision-making.
    + Investment, output-mix, pricing, credit, employment, entry, and exit.
    
---

- Especially harmful were the controls on foreign trade and investment that stemmed from the belief in ‘selfreliance’.

- They resulted in India becoming something of a backwater, isolated from the benefits of international division of labour and diffusion of technology.

- The domain of the public sector extended well beyond the traditional utilities and included large swathes of manufacturing industry, many consumer goods, and even hotels.

---

- Public sector enterprises were expected to be highly profitable and to serve as the spearhead of investment. 
- The reality was different. Returns in most public sector firms were abysmally low. Many of them not only made losses but became ‘sick’, a polite Indian word for bankrupt.
- Neglect of the social sectors was the third feature of economic policy that led to slow growth; and it also contributed to making growth non-inclusive.

---

- The phenomenal success of the East Asian economies was based on solid achievements in education and health care (in addition to their outward-oriented trade policies).
- India’s performance in these areas was dismal.
- Part of the reason for this failure was of course **low growth itself** and the consequent **shortage of revenues that could finance social expenditures**.

---

- Another reason for India’s poor comparative performance is arguably that **it started from a somewhat lower base** than the East Asian economies (other than China).
- But that defence does not really work since changes in human indicators such as **life expectancy, infant mortality, and adult literacy were much faster in China and South Korea than in India** (see Table 2.3)

![Table 2.2](LongRoadTable2.2.PNG)


---

- Not surprisingly, slow growth and neglect of human development also led to a comprehensive failure in poverty alleviation. 
- The <font>**headcount poverty ratio**</font>, which <u>measures the proportion of poor people below an officially defined poverty line</u>, was broadly constant between the 1950s and 1977/78 (see Table 2.4). 
-  In the 1950s, more than half the population was below the poverty line, a situation that remained unchanged throughout the first three post-independence decades. 
    + <u>Since population growth was rapid, this implied large additions to the absolute numbers of poor people. The number of people in poverty rose by nearly 120 million over the period, from 210 million to 329 million (see Table 2.4)</u>.

##  <mark1> PARTIAL REFORM SINCE 1980:THE POLITICAL BACKDROP</mark1>

- Mrs. Gandhi returned to power in January 1980 in the middle of a drought, an oil price shock, and a macroeconomic crisis.

>- The government tried, and largely succeeded, in undertaking an <a title=" Expansionary policy is macroeconomic policy that seeks to boost aggregate demand through monetary and fiscal stimulus. Expansionary policy is intended to prevent or moderate economic downturns and recessions. Though popular, expansionary policy can involve significant costs and risks including macroeconomic, macroeconomic, and political economy issues." data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="hover" data-content="Some content">expansionary adjustment</a> without cutting public investment, with the help of a large IMF loan. 

>- Public investment rose as intended but the fiscal position deteriorated. 

---

- Politically there was increasing tension, mainly because of a separatist movement in Punjab.

>- This eventually led Mrs. Gandhi to order the army to storm the Golden Temple in Amritsar, which had become the militants’ headquarters. 

>- In revenge, she was assassinated by two of her own bodyguards in October 1984. <a title="Congress Party, named after Mrs. Indira Gandhi" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="hover" data-content="Some content">Congress (I)</a>, led by her son Rajiv Gandhi, won a national election, already scheduled, on a wave of sympathy, with a massive near-four-fifths majority in parliament

---

- Rajiv Gandhi had a modern, managerial style and wanted to shed the
ideological baggage of the past. 

>- He took a number of liberalizing measures in his first two years in office. 
>- The turning point came in 1987 when his reputation was brought into question by allegations of corruption relating to the purchase of artillery from the Swedish firm Bofors. 
>- There were other difficulties too, including a massive agitation, led by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), to demolish a 16th century mosque that had allegedly been built on the site of the birthplace of the Hindu god Rama. 

---

- Faced with manifold personal and political problems, Rajiv Gandhi lost the impetus for economic reform. 

>- He called an election in late 1989, hoping to get a new and convincing mandate. 
>- The National Front, a combination of various opposition parties, campaigned successfully on the issue of corruption, and Congress (I) suffered a humiliating defeat. 
>- In December of that year, V. P. Singh formed a minority government with parliamentary support from the BJP and the Communists but its position was rickety. 

---

- In August 1990, oil prices doubled following the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. 

>- Given the fiscal position, which had been worsening throughout the 1980s, this shock affected not only the current account of the balance of payments but also the capital account.

>- Acute difficulties began to be experienced in new commercial borrowing and even in rolling over existing short-term loans and credits, and reserves fell sharply.

---

- Communal and caste conflicts also grew apace, especially over V. P. Singh’s attempt to implement the recommendations of the Mandal Commission: 

    >* which had recommended in 1980 that 27 per cent of government posts should be reserved for ‘Other Backward Castes’, in addition to the 22.5 per cent constitutionally reserved for ‘Scheduled Castes and Tribes’. 
    
---

- The country staggered on with minority governments until a new election was called in May 1991.

>- The day after it began, Rajiv Gandhi was assassinated. Congress (I) won 226 seats, 30 short of an overall majority, and formed a minority government, with P. V. Narasimha Rao as prime minister and Manmohan Singh, an economist–civil servant of wide domestic and international experience, as Finance Minister. 

---

- The government’s inheritance was grim. 

    >- Inflation was 12 per cent a year and rising. 
    >- The <a title="The current account deficit is a measurement of a country’s trade where the value of the goods and services it imports exceeds the value of the products it exports. The current account includes net income, such as interest and dividends, and transfers, such as foreign aid, although these components make up only a small percentage of the total current account. The current account represents a country’s foreign transactions and, like the capital account, is a component of a country’s balance of payments (BOP)." data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="hover" data-content="Some content">current account deficit</a> was 3.5 per cent of GDP and 45 per cent of exports. 
    >- Reserves were down to two weeks’ imports. 
    >- The <a title="A fiscal deficit is a shortfall in a government's income compared with its spending. The government that has a fiscal deficit is spending beyond its means. A fiscal deficit is calculated as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP), or simply as total dollars spent in excess of income. In either case, the income figure includes only taxes and other revenues and excludes money borrowed to make up the shortfall." data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="hover" data-content="Some content">fiscal deficit</a> was more than 10 per cent of GDP. 
    >- The <a title="The ratio of gross external debt to exports provides a quick indicator of the capability of an economy to repay external debt with enhanced revenue from sales to foreign countries. A ratio below 1 suggests that debt can be repaid rapidly, theoretically in less than one year." data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="hover" data-content="Some content">external debt to exports ratio</a>  was 250 per cent, well up from 150 per cent in 1980. 
    
---

- The new government moved swiftly to announce a programme of stabilization and liberalization. 

>- In 1991/92, <a title="Fiscal retrenchment means that a government has to introduce deflationary fiscal measures designed to reduce the amount of borrowing and debt that has been run up during the downturn and economic/financial crisis. Ultimately fiscal retrenchment can be achieved in one of two ways: (1) Raising indirect and direct taxation, (2) Making cuts in the real level of government spending" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="hover" data-content="Some content">fiscal retrenchment</a> was undertaken, combined with a devaluation of the rupee, and supported by a standby credit from the IMF. 

>- Growth crashed to negative levels for a year because of the combined effects of erratic weather and fiscal contraction. 
>- But the recession proved to be temporary. There was a smart recovery in the following year, along with a reduction in fiscal and current account deficits.

---

- In the period 1980/81 to 1992/93, the growth rate averaged 5.2 per cent a year, a large rise compared with 3.5 percent in the previous 30 years.
- Vijay Joshi and Ian Little attributed this acceleration to the following main factors: 
    - higher and more stable investment; 
    - an increase in efficiency as a result of some liberalization; and
    - rampantly expansionary macroeconomic policies.
    
---

- Investment in the 1980s went up to an average of 21 per cent of GDP compared with 17 per cent in the previous 15 years.
- Both public and corporate investment rose
- Productivity increased as a result of various moves towards liberalization, hesitant though they were. 
- But the higher growth was also based on large increases in government and foreign borrowing, so it contained the seeds of its own destruction.

---

- The Narshima Rao government started the process of liberalisation reform as soon as he took over in 1991.
- There was a fear that Indian economy would not withstand foreign competition.
- Rao gave cover and full support to Manmohan Singh's samll band of reformers.
- Liberalization led to a sizeable increase in economic efficiency.

---

- The BJP government, elected in 1996, carried forward the process of economic reform. 
- There was some further liberalization of trade, finance, and foreign investment, and a beginning was made with privatization of loss-making public sector enterprises. 
- There were also some advances in infrastructure provision, particularly roads, electricity, and telecommunications, though the shortfall remained large.

---

- Growth was ‘super-fast’ (around 8.5 per cent a year, 7 per cent per head per year) from 2003/4 to 2010/11. 
- The global credit crisis broke in 2008. India’s growth slipped to 6.7 per cent during 2008/9 but rebounded to more than 8 per cent for the next three years, driven by the pre-existing momentum of domestic consumption and investment.

- But there was a sharp slowdown thereafter: from 2011/12 to 2013/14, growth fell to around 5 per cent a year. 

## THE PARTIAL REFORM MODEL: GROWTH SINCE 1980
- Reformist ideas had begun to gather steam from the late 1970s onwards.
- government enacted some business-friendly policy measures. 
- The liberalization that Mrs Gandhi initiated, and Rajiv Gandhi furthered, was hesitant, piecemeal, and more ‘business-friendly’ than ‘market-friendly’. But it worked because India was then far inside the efficiency frontier due to misguided past policies.

---

- India grew at 5.6 percent during the 1980s.
- This led some commentators to denigrate the importance of the reforms of 1990.
- In the author's view this is quite wrong. 

    >-  fast growth in the 1980s was due to over-expansionary fiscal policy and foreign borrowing.
    >- phenomenal rise in the consolidated fiscal deficit. 5% of GDP in 1970s, 8% in first half of 1980s, 10% to the end of the last decade.

---

- India grew at 5.6 percent during the 1980s.
- This led some commentators to denigrate the importance of the reforms of 1990.
- In the author's view this is quite wrong. 
    
    >-  Reform was shallow: There was little in the way of introducing genuine competition, domestic or international. 
    >- Without the more significant changes undertaken after 1991, output acceleration would have fizzled out.
    
---

- Inidia borrowed from IMF under the structural adjectment programme. 
- With the collapse of communism India's earlier philosophy lost its momentum. 

>- A programme of reform, more radical than anything attempted in the previous decade, was initiated in July 1991 by the Narasimha Rao government. 

---

- The thrust of the reforms was to roll back controls in trade, industry, and finance, thereby increasing the market orientation of the economy.

>- Quantitative import controls on capital goods and raw materials were abolished, import tariffs were slashed, investment licensing was scrapped in most industries, and significant moves were made to open up the economy to foreign direct and portfolio investment. 

---

- For 10 years after 1993, growth was 6 per cent a year, higher than the 5.2 per cent rate achieved in the previous 10 years.
- For eight years from 2003, there was a further acceleration in GDP to a super-fast growth rate of 8.5 per cent a year. 
- This was so, even though the period included 2008/9, the year in which the global financial crisis broke.

---

- There were some exogenous favourable factors that contributed to fast growth such as 

    >- the strong tail wind from the world economy before the financial crisis, 
    >- low oil prices and 
    >- good harvests. 

---

- But a significant part of the credit for the acceleration must also go to the cumulative effects of the reforms since 1991; given the favourable
environment, they produced a phenomenal rise in corporate savings and
investment, and overall productivity. 
- Strikingly, nearly all the states grew faster from 2000 to 2010 than in the previous decade.

---

- Finally, the bubble burst. The proximate cause of the slowdown from 2011/12 was a collapse of corporate investment.
- The major reasons for the collapse

    >- the souring of the investment climate caused by ‘governance failures’. The government was involved in several major scandals and scams, whose exposure led to a period of policy paralysis. Many projects that required various clearances to proceed came to a standstill.

---

- Finally, the bubble burst. The proximate cause of the slowdown from 2011/12 was a collapse of corporate investment.
- The major reasons for the collapse

  >- Worsening macroeconomic outlook: 
    
    >- Inflation was around 10 per cent a year for six years from 2008.
      
    >- As a result, household savings were diverted to gold imports andthe current account deficit widened to the dangerous level of 4.5 per cent of GDP in 2011/12 and 2012/13. 

## Questions
1. Why did India fail to achieve rapid growth for three decades after independence (1950–1980)?
